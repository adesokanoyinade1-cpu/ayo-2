    <h2>My Dearest AYO 💕</h2>

    <p class="long-text">
        On this beautiful milestone — 20 on the 20th — I just want you to know
        how incredibly special you are. Your presence is a gift. Your smile is warmth.
        Your existence alone makes the world better.

        May this new chapter bring clarity, success, peace, and a love so pure
        that it never leaves your life.

        I hope every prayer you whisper becomes a testimony.
        I hope every fear turns into courage.
        I hope joy finds you daily.

        Happy Birthday, AYO.
        This is your year.
    </p>
